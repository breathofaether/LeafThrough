# LeafThrough

Leaf-through is a react.js application that assists users in discovering and rediscovering their favorite books. It provides functionalities for searching for books online, manually adding them to a list, receiving a surprise book recommendation from the list, and exploring a curated selection of new books.

## Features

Search for books using the integrated Google Books API. 
* Manually add books to a personal list. 
* Receive a surprise book recommendation from the user's list. 
* Discover new books through a curated selection.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js (with hooks and refs)

- Backend: Firestore Database (NoSQL)
    
- Styling: CSS with animations and hover effects
    
- API Integration: Google Books API
    
- Other: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), Toastify (Notifications)

## Deployment

- Live at: https://leafthrough.netlify.app.

## Firebase Integration
This project uses Firebase for:
- Storing and managing book data (Favorites, Read Later, etc.)
- Saving and retrieving user notes
- Real-time updates for UI consistency

### Branch Information
The Firebase integration resides in the `feature/firebase-integration` branch. However, the live site at [Netlify](https://leafthrough.netlify.app) is updated to use Firebase.

#### Performance Note
Users may experience slight latency during some operations (e.g., adding or deleting books, saving notes). This is due to the Firebase database being hosted in a European region, which may introduce network delays depending on the user's geographic location.
